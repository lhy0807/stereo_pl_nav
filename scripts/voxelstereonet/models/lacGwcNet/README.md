#### Contributions
- A novel pairwise feature LSP to extract structural information, which is beneficial for accurate matching especially when the illumination of the image pair is imbalanced
- A novel disparity refinement method CSR (or DSR to save memory) to deal with outliers that are difficult to match, e.g. disparity discontinuities and occluded regions.
